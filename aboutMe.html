		<h2>Hi, I'm Milos</h2>
		<div id='blockOfText'>
			<p>I work as a Marie Curie Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Institute of Security and Global Affairs (ISGA) at Leiden University on post-war pathways of foreign fighters. Previously, I worked as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Center on the Future of War at Arizona State University, and a Research Consultant for Columbia University in New York on a Minerva project exploring major power rivalry. I also taught research design and qualitative methods at Central European University. With the rise of ISIS, I took part in policy debates about terrorism and military intervention and appeared on a number of TV channels including N1 (the CNN affiliate in the Western Balkans), Serbian National Television and Al-Jazeera Balkans. My research interests are at the intersection of civil war dynamics and postwar politics in the Balkans.</p>
